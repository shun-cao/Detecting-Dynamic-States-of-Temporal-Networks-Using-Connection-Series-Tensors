# Detecting-Dynamic-States-of-Temporal-Networks-Using-Connection-Series-Tensors

This is the code used to detect system states of temporal networks (time-varying networks). We propose a new method for detecting dynamic states in temporal networks using connection series (i.e., time series of connection status) between nodes. We apply a similarity measure informed by the techniques of processing time series and community detection to sequentially decompose a given temporal network into multiple dynamic states (including repeated ones).

The code was written in Python 3.
